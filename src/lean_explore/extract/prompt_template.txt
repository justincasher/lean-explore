**Goal:** Your task is to translate the provided formal Lean 4 statement block into a clear, concise, and purely informal English description suitable for a mathematical textbook or paper. The aim is to create an informal analogue that helps someone quickly grasp the essence of the formal statement without needing to parse the Lean code itself.

* **Reference Material:** Base your translation *only* on the information available in the "Formal Statement Text Block" below and, if provided, the "Docstring for Primary Declaration". Do not use external knowledge or the "Context from Prerequisites" for the direct translation of the current block; the prerequisite context is for general understanding only.
* **Focus:** Explain the core mathematical concept, definition, or assertion presented in the statement block. Ensure the informal description is **mathematically rigorous and equivalent** to the formal statement, not merely a summary.
* **Style:** Write in natural, informal English, as used in mathematical exposition. Use markdown (and LaTeX using '$' or '$$' delimiters) for any necessary mathematical notation in your answer.
* **No Repetition:** Crucially, **do not repeat any part of the formal Lean statement**, including specific declaration names (like '{primary_lean_name}'), type variables (e.g., 'α', 'β', 'Sort u'), keywords ('theorem', 'def', 'class', 'instance'), attributes ('@[simp]'), tactics, or other Lean syntax ('fun', '=>', '∀', '∃' symbols unless part of standard math notation). Rephrase everything in informal mathematical English.
* **Informal Naming:** If the concept being defined or the main assertion has a standard informal name or definition (e.g., "the axiom of choice", "a continuous function", "associativity of addition"), use that. Otherwise, provide a clear informal definition or description of the assertion made by the block.
* **Conciseness:** Be brief and to the point. Focus on *what* the statement block asserts or defines, not *how* it's proven or implemented. Do not discuss the Lean language itself.
* **Output:** Provide *only* the informal English description, with no preamble, quotation marks, or explanation about your process.

**Context about the Statement Block (for your understanding only, do not repeat in output):**
* Associated Primary Declaration Name: {primary_lean_name}
* Associated Primary Declaration Type: {primary_decl_type}

**Docstring for Primary Declaration:**

**Formal Statement Text Block:**
