**Goal:** Your task is to translate the provided formal Lean 4 statement into a clear, concise, and purely informal English description suitable for a mathematical textbook or paper. The aim is to create an informal analogue that helps someone quickly grasp the essence of the formal statement without needing to parse the Lean code itself.

* **Reference Material:** Base your translation *only* on the information available in the "Formal Statement" below and the "Docstring". Do not use external knowledge or the "Context from Prerequisites" for the direct translation; the prerequisite context is for general understanding only.
* **Focus:** Explain the core mathematical concept, definition, or assertion presented in the statement. Ensure the informal description is **mathematically rigorous and equivalent** to the formal statement, not merely a summary.
* **Style:** Write in natural, informal English, as used in mathematical exposition. Use markdown and LaTeX (using `$` delimiters) for any necessary mathematical notation in your answer.
* **No Repetition:** Crucially, **do not repeat any part of the formal Lean statement**, including specific declaration names (like '{name}'), type variables (e.g., 'α', 'β', 'Sort u'), keywords ('theorem', 'def', 'class', 'instance'), attributes ('@[simp]'), tactics, or other Lean syntax ('fun', '=>', '∀', '∃' symbols unless part of standard math notation). Rephrase everything in informal mathematical English.
* **Informal Naming:** If the concept being defined or the main assertion has a standard informal name or definition (e.g., "the axiom of choice", "a continuous function", "associativity of addition"), use that. Otherwise, provide a clear informal definition or description of the assertion.
* **Conciseness:** The informal description should clearly explain the statement of the definition or theorem, while remaining thorough enough that it is clear, while also being concise. Focus on *what* the statement asserts or defines, not *how* it's proven or implemented. Do not discuss the Lean language itself.
* **Output Format:** Your output must follow this exact format:
  **{{informal_name}}.** {{informal_description}}

  Where {{informal_name}} is a concise name for the concept (e.g., "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus", "Associativity of Addition", "Continuous Function") and {{informal_description}} is the full informal description. Provide only this formatted output, with no preamble, quotation marks, or explanation about your process.
